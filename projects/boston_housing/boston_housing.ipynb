    "## Getting Started\n",
    "In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n",

    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n",
    "- 16 data points have an `'MEDV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.\n",
    "- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.\n",
    "- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MEDV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.\n",
    "- The feature `'MEDV'` has been **multiplicatively scaled** to account for 35 years of market inflation.\n",

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "RM: An increase of RM means that there are for example 10 instead of (only) 7 rooms among homes in the neighborhood on average. I assume that such an increase leads to an increase of MEDV, as there might be higher square meter living space, too, which therefore justifies a higher price. But, if (like in the example) the value RM is only slightly higher, it does not necessarily mean that MEDV is also higher. The living space could be just as large, with (many) smaller or (fewer) larger rooms.\n",
    "\n",
    "LSTAT: An increase of LSTAT (like a value of 20) means that in the neighborhood life more people from a low income class than in a neighborhood with a LSTAT of 15. I assume that a higher LSTAT goes along with a decrease in MEDV for the following reasons: The people who live in this neighborhood have a small income, and yet they can afford to live there. Thus the prices might decrease. Furthermore, the neughborhood is such that it does not attract people from wealthier backgrounds; not like-minded people, because the people there live a lower standard of living, possibly bad conditions for children. It could be even more insecure to live in the neighborhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "PTRATIO: An increase of PTRATIO means that there are more students to less teachers. I assume such an increase results in a decrease of MEDV: More students and less teachers could indicate an insufficient school education and not enough financial resources for education at school. Additionally, schools with a higher PTRATIO might not be able to prepare students adequatelly for going to university later. Therefore, a high PTRATIO might indicate a low MEDV."

    "### Implementation: Fitting a Model\n",
    "Your final implementation requires that you bring everything together and train a model using the **decision tree algorithm**. To ensure that you are producing an optimized model, you will train the model using the grid search technique to optimize the `'max_depth'` parameter for the decision tree. The `'max_depth'` parameter can be thought of as how many questions the decision tree algorithm is allowed to ask about the data before making a prediction. Decision trees are part of a class of algorithms called *supervised learning algorithms*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you will find your implementation is using `ShuffleSplit()` for an alternative form of cross-validation (see the `'cv_sets'` variable). While it is not the K-Fold cross-validation technique you describe in **Question 8**, this type of cross-validation technique is just as useful!. The `ShuffleSplit()` implementation below will create 10 (`'n_splits'`) shuffled sets, and for each shuffle, 20% (`'test_size'`) of the data will be used as the *validation set*. While you're working on your implementation, think about the contrasts and similarities it has to the K-fold cross-validation technique.\n",

    "For the `fit_model` function in the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Use [`DecisionTreeRegressor`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor.html) from `sklearn.tree` to create a decision tree regressor object.\n",
    "  - Assign this object to the `'regressor'` variable.\n",
    "- Create a dictionary for `'max_depth'` with the values from 1 to 10, and assign this to the `'params'` variable.\n",
    "- Use [`make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html) from `sklearn.metrics` to create a scoring function object.\n",
    "  - Pass the `performance_metric` function as a parameter to the object.\n",
    "  - Assign this scoring function to the `'scoring_fnc'` variable.\n",
    "- Use [`GridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/0.20/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html) from `sklearn.model_selection` to create a grid search object.\n",
